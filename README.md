# Rydeen

Rydeen is a daemon to map keyboard/gesture event to key input/shell command.

Rydeen is built on top of libinput and uinput, with libev for event handling.

# Configuration

The configuration file is either of `./config.yml` or `/etc/rydeen/config.yml`.

All detected keyboards are exclusively grabbed by this program and key events are sent instead by an uinput device. Key events that don't match any of modifiers or keybinds/gesturebinds are automatically sent identically by uinput.
However, since this program doesn't grab mouse, mouse button events are never sent except for those described in `action`.

The type `keysym` is `string` that represents XKB's keysym. You can check out the keysym by running `xkbcli interactive-evdev [--layout (your keyboard layout)]`.
Additionally, some keysyms for mouse buttons are added: `"mouse:left"`, `"mouse:right"`, `"mouse:middle"`, `"mouse:forward"`, `"mouse:backward"`.

The type `action` is `string` | `array` that represents a key/command action.<br>
If `string`, this node represents a command action and the value is executed by shell (e.g. `"brightnessctl s +10%"`).<br>
If `array`, this node represents a key action and each element of this node represents a state of a key. Elements are `keysym`s which can be prefixed with `+` or `-`, with each represents pressing and releasing (e.g. `["+Control_L", "w", "-Control_L"]` means "Press left control and click (press and release) W and release left control").

The type `swipe_direction` is `"up"` \| `"down"` \|`"left"` \|`"right"`.
